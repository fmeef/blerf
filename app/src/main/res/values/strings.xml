        Initiate a long-running scan for devices in the background. This discovers both bluetooth
        LE advertises and attempts both a connection and service discovery. Please use as
        your own risk, as this is more disruptive than just scanning for advertises. If peripherals
        in the environment are well-designed this should not affect them though.
